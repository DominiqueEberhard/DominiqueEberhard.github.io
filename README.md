# [Sample Python Project](https://github.com/DominiqueEberhard/Sample_Python_Project)
- This project is a YouTube Bot that uses Python and the Selenium library to randomly watch a video from an array of video links
- Randomly chooses a browser, opens it, plays the video for a random percentage of the watchtime (within set bounds) and closes the browser
- Different execution depending on the specific browser (Safari, Chrome, Firefox)
- The program then provides a summary of how many times each video was played
- Intended to be excuted on a MacOS device, with chromedriver and geckodriver needing to be installed to work
- *Note: this project is only intended as a practive project and has never been used to artificially inflate viewcounts (e.g. viewing duration is kept purposely short so as to not count as a view on youtube)*
- (btw the links are to my own YouTube videos)

# [Sample JavaScript Project](https://github.com/DominiqueEberhard/Sample_JavaScript_Projects)
- My solutions to the final projects at the end of FreeCodeCamp.org's JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms Certificate
- If pressed for time, I recommend looking at the "Cash Register" file or the "Roman Numeral Converter"
- These projects helped me refine my comand of JavaScript and enhance understanding of Object-Oriented Programming in practice

# [Sample Swift Project](https://github.com/DominiqueEberhard/Sample_Swift_Project)
- My contribution to a collaborative project I did with my brother; I took care of the front-end matters (the actual project is in a private repository on my machine; I used this file as a space to work and pushed the finished code to the actual project file, hence the name "SwiftUIAnimationPractice")
- I created multiple animated loading screens and a "Splash Screen", in addition to desigining all of the visual and audio asset from scratch
- I also drew the logos that I designed with SwiftUI paths and with the help of an online tool that converts XML to SwiftUI paths for certain tricky portions of the logo
- Run the "ContentViewTest" file in the Xcode project to get an idea of what it should look like

# [Sample HTML & CSS Project](https://github.com/DominiqueEberhard/Sample_HTML-CSS_Project)
- This is a facetious webpage that I designed as a project for FreeCodeCamp.org's HMTL and CSS curriculum
- This was created using CodePen.io, hence the MIT license upon exporitng the project
- *Note: the text on the mock-landing page are all intended to be humorous and tongue-in-cheek*
